# Q4 Sales Promo Summary

Our customer success team reported a 12% lift in attachment revenue after the October bundle campaign. The concise FAQ card and the staging walkthrough video were cited as the top two assets. Regional managers requested we keep those pieces refreshed every quarter.

Pricing analysts confirmed the enterprise loyalty discount still returns positive margin. A three-week hold on additional discounts remains in place while we monitor churn on legacy bronze tiers. Finance is fine with extended payment terms in APAC only.

Implementation lead notes
- Zendesk macro is live in all regions.
- Updated onboarding email went out on November 2.
- All-hands enablement call replay sits in SharePoint with chapter markers.

Final touchpoint: Set up the December customer advisory meeting agenda by Friday to capture feedback before the holiday freeze.
